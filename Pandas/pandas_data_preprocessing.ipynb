    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing is a key step in building effective machine learning models. It involves preparing and transforming raw data into a clean and structured format. The main stages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integration**: Combining data from multiple sources (e.g., CSV files, databases, APIs) into a unified dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and filtering out noise or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Transformation**:\n",
    "  - **Encoding**: Converting categorical data into numerical format using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "  - **Scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing features using techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Standardization.\n",
    "  - **Feature Engineering**: Creating new meaningful features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Reduction**: Reducing the number of features or records (e.g., via PCA or feature selection) while retaining important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.\n",
